- Product Manager at [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com). I'm really excited to work on a product I've admired as a user for several years.
- Building MegaDesk, a deeply over-engineered desk setup that can transition between sitting, standing, and walking (blog post coming soon).
- Trying to make the upcoming year one of routine and habit building. I function much better with established schedules and routines, but I am paradoxically bad at keeping them. Iâ€™m trying to approach it with a gentler mindset this time.
