- Product Manager at [HashiCorp](https://hashicorp.com), focusing on [Vault’s](https://vaultproject.io) cloud and application ecosystem. I'm really proud of what my team is working on right now, and I'm supporting a really incredible group of engineers and designers.
- Really enjoying hanging out on Mastodon— specifically, [Hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io)! There's a very peaceful and nerdy atmosphere there right now. I love learning about the cool things everyone is working on!
- Building a Mastodon client to stretch my front end development skills.
- Tuning up a 3D printer that my brother and I designed and built.
- Trying to make the upcoming year one of routine and habit building. I function much better with established schedules and routines, but I am paradoxically bad at keeping them. I’m trying to approach it with a gentler mindset this time.
