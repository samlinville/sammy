I’ve done my best to build this site in a way that is maximally respectful of each visitor’s privacy. I use a single privacy-respecting analytics tool— Plausible— to measure traffic on my website. This site is deployed on Vercel and makes a minimal number of API calls to a small backend service that I maintain on Fly.io. Vercel and Fly may be tracking who makes requests to their servers, I do not know; I am not able to see this data.
